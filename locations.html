      - The K Munich Unterfoehring: 3 min away from the conference location, but pretty far outside the city (~25min by public transport), 30min away from the airport, 40min away from the Hackathon location
- Hotels around the Munich East Station (München Ostbahnhof): eg. Courtyard Munich City East or Motel One Munich City East (München City Ost): excellent public transport connections, located between the conference(~25min) and the hackathon location (~15min), 45min to the airport, 2 stations away from fpletz and globins office, we are also thinking about doing the social event on saturday evening somewhere in this area as there are a lot of nice bars and restaurants nearby
- a bit more low-cost and a bit away from Munich East is the ibis hotel Munich City East
- Unterfoehring, where the conference takes place, is reachable via the line S8. The S8 also goes through the city center (Marienplatz, Main Station, Karlsplatz, etc ), any other hotel nearby those would also be fine, I think
