<p>The utility of Nix/nixpkgs as a development tool is still unparalleled.
However, the industry is moving towards containers and orchestrators, and I argue that
NixOS and NixOps are becoming less relevant now that the industry is moving to this new model.
</p><p>
These changes might actually pose an existential threat to Nix, given that (container) build
systems might get \"good enough\".
Alternatives that operate in the same area are Bazel by Google, Habitat by Chef, the new BuildKit by Docker.
</p><p>
My question to you is: how could we leverage this move to containers/orchestrators, and archieve World Domination?</p>",
